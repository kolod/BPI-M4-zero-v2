To enable wifi on the m4 zero v2 copy the .dtb provided by armbian - c0rnelius into the /boot/dtb-6.6.36-current-sunxi64/allwinner/ 
This will change based off your kernel version.

Edit `/boot/armbianEnv.txt`: ftdfile=allwinner/sun50i-h618-bananapi-m4-zero.dtb

BT- not currently working requires possible gpio rewrite or further investigating.
